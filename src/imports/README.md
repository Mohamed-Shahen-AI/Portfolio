# LinkedIn Jobs Auto-Apply Workflow

An n8n automation workflow that scrapes LinkedIn job postings, evaluates their relevance using AI, and automatically generates personalized cover letters — all on a scheduled basis.

## Overview

This workflow automates the job hunting process in 3 steps:

1. **Scrape & deduplicate** new LinkedIn job postings
2. **AI-score** each job for relevance against your resume
3. **Generate a personalized cover letter** for relevant jobs

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1 — Get and Remove Duplicated Jobs
Runs on a **weekly schedule** and:
- Reads existing jobs from a Google Sheet to build a list of already-seen postings
- Scrapes up to 100 new LinkedIn job postings via the **Apify LinkedIn Jobs Scraper** actor
- Filters out duplicates by comparing `Company + Job Title` against existing records
- Appends only **new jobs** to the Google Sheet with fields: Company, Job Title, URL, Apply URL, Description, Location, and Posted Date

### Step 2 — Check Job Relevance
Runs on a **per-minute schedule** and:
- Reads unprocessed job rows from the Google Sheet
- Fetches the candidate's resume from Google Docs
- Builds a prompt combining the job description and resume
- Sends it to an **AI Agent** (via OpenRouter) with a **Structured Output Parser** to score relevance
- If the job is **not relevant** → deletes the row from the sheet
- If the job **is relevant** → proceeds to Step 3, or marks it as reviewed
- Uses a **Telegram tool** to notify the candidate about relevant matches

### Step 3 — Prepare Cover Letter
Triggered by relevant jobs passing Step 2:
- Builds a tailored prompt from the job description and resume
- Sends it to a second **AI Agent** (via OpenRouter) to generate a professional cover letter (under 250 words)
- Creates a new **Google Doc** with the cover letter content
- Updates the Google Doc with final formatting
- Updates the Google Sheet row with the cover letter document link

`.trim();
```

## Notes

- The **deduplication** logic uses a `Company-JobTitle` composite key, so the same role at a different company will not be filtered out.
- The Apify actor is configured to scrape **n8n-related jobs worldwide** by default. Update the URL in the **Run an Actor** node to target different roles or locations.
- Both AI Agents use **OpenRouter**, so you can swap the underlying model (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, etc.) without changing the workflow structure.
- The workflow is set to **inactive** by default — activate each trigger manually after setup.
